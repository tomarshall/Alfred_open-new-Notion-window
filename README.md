# Alfred_open-new-notion-window
This Alfred workflow opens a new Notion window when supplied the keyword "nn".

The new Notion window will open to the same page you were working on prior to that in your other Notion window.

If you want the Notion window to open in your current desktop/space when the currently open Notion page is on a different desktop/space, be sure to go to System Preferences > Mission Control and deselect the checkbox labelled "when switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for that application".
