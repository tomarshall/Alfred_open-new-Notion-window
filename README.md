# Alfred_open-new-notion-window
This Alfred workflow opens a new Notion window when supplied the keyword "nn".

To make the shortcut open your Notion page within Notion's Mac App (rather than in your browser), simply copy the link to your Notion page (which is just a regular old URL), delete the `https` at the beginning of the URL in the NSAppleScript, and replace the `https` with `notion` so that you end up with a link that starts like this: "notion://www.notion...". 

Replace the test page link I put in the NSAppleScript with your own link, and you're ready to go!
